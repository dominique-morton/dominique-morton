Hi! I'm Dominique, a professional data analyst with current experience on 2 technical projects. My skills include business analytics, data visualization, data-driven storytelling, Python, SQL, and Machine Learning. I'm eager to utilize my big data and visualization skills in the media & gaming sphere to predict trends, drive growth, and boost sales.

Currently I'm working with customer data to analyze the correlation between users purchasing habits and increasing business metrics. My previous experience in digital marketing and years of collaborating with clients have helped me develop my communication, analytical, time-management, and problem solving skills. In January 2024, I enrolled in the TripleTen 10 month Data Science program. The currriculum extensively covers Python (Pandas, NumPy, PandaSql), data visualization (Matplotlib, Plotly, Tableau), machine learning (scikit-learn, NLTK, TensorFlow), SQL, and more. It also involved numerous real-world data projects. 

As I continue my learning journey, I will be participating in an externship program. Stay tuned & learn more about my growing knowledge and other projects in my repositories!

Some facts about me:
• 👀 I enjoy participating in various data projects & user-groups such as the UC Davis Data Science Capstone Project, and Orange County Tableau User Group.

• 🏃🏾 I love running, my current long-distance achievement is 10 miles straight.

• 🥋 i'm currently training in the discipline of Brazilian Jiu Jitzu.

• 🧑🏾‍🎨 I'm adept in many forms of artistic expression ([Music](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3KKWEnjscGCpUVDSRAlzNt?si=iodDf9UgQbe4--_ko7xHqA), Drawing, Painting, [Acting](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm7397313/?ref_=ext_shr_lnk))

• 🎯 My Goal for 2024: landing my dream job in data, and being a great Dad to my newborn!
